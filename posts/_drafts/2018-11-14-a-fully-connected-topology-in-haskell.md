title: "A Fully Connected Network Topology in Haskell"
tags: [programming]

A fully connected network is one where every node is connected to every other 
node.
Fully connected networks are perhaps the simplest form of a mesh network.
Mesh networks maximize the number of connections between nodes. 
Then clients communicate without going through a central location like a server.
On a fully connected network, all clients communicate directly.

I thought it would be interesting to play around with a fully connected network 
in Haskell.
