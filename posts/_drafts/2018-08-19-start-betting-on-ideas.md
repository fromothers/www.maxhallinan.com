Kyle Simpson recently gave a talk titled "Keep Betting on JavaScript".
The title is a reference to Brendan Eich's encouragement to 
"always bet on JavaScript".

Languages, libraries, frameworks, patterns &mdash; these are all the ephemera of
ideas.
The question should not be "should I use React or Vue?"
The question should be "what are the fundamental ideas of React and Vue?"
And then, "what do I think about those ideas?"

Ideas in programming are the most portable unit of knowledge.
Ideas are have the longest lifespan.
For me, the basic idea of React is that the view is a function of state.
The essence of React has nothing to do lifecycle methods, asynchronous rendering.
It's not even exactly about the virtual DOM.
These are details and often distractions.
The idea is that I define my view as a function from state to dom.
The type of the Elm architecture function is `view : a -> Html`.
This is often refined to `view : Model -> Html`.

The benefit I get from React is the ability to reason about my view as a 
function of application state.
The rest of it is not important to me.
It might sometimes be useful.
But what I take away is the idea.

Investing in the idea gives me the freedom to move away from any particular 
implementation.
Owning the idea gives me a value that I can spend anywhere.
If I stopped using React tomorrow, I can still use that fundamental idea of 
React.

Knowledge of libraries is a currency that can be spent anywhere the library is
used.
Libraries are the amusement park tokens of the programming world.
This knowledge is not very valuable and it's value does not last for very long.
Knowledge of languages is a currency that can be spent anywhere that the 
language is used.
Languages are the fiat currencies of the programming world.
This knowledge can be quite valuable and the value can last for a long time.
Ideas are a currency that can be spent anywhere.
Ideas are the gold of the programming world.
Their value enjoys near universal and timeless recognition.

That is not to say that all ideas are gold.
Some ideas seem good at the outset and are proven wrong through experience.
But when you have found an idea that works for you in practice, then you have
found something of value.
That is the thing you should invest in.

I like React because it allows me to leverage a good idea.
But I'm not attached to React because I can take that good idea somewhere else.
Eventually, I will.
Or I will find a better idea.
