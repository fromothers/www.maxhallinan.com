title: When to Learn

I recently authored ["When should I learn Redux?"](http://redux.js.org/docs/faq/General.html#general-when-to-learn) for the Redux FAQ. My answer to this question summarizes several sources compiled by the Redux maintainers. In that sense, the words are mine but the ideas are not. I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to a project I love and I'm not unhappy with my contribution, but I feel uncomfortable with a premise of the argument my contribution makes.

My own answer to "When should I learn Redux?" is simply that you should feel free to learn Redux (or any subject) at any time. No one should have to ask permission to cross the threshold from ignorance to understanding. Need and desire are both excellent incitements to learn, but a need to learn should not be required to justify the desire.

When I was a child, I was curious about ancient civilizations. At the library, the most satisfying books about ancient civilizations were found in the "adult" section. As I waited in line with my selections, the man behind me said (more to the librarian than to me) that he wanted to check out the books I was holding. 

The social contract of libraries is clear that one should wait patiently and graciously for a book that someone else has selected. But my age enabled the librarian to rationalize an exception for this man. According to her, I was not old enough for these books.

To be "old enough" for these particular books did not mean that the librarian found the content inappropriate for a child. I don't think the library engaged in that kind of censorship. I had borrowed Frank Miller's violent and sexual _The Dark Knight Returns_ several times from the same library and these were relatively academic books. 

This was an economic rather than a moral judgment. Age was used to measure manufacturing capacity. The man, being older than me, had a greater capacity to manufacture understanding. The librarian gave him the books as the best allocation of this finite resource of information. 

Maybe this is a valid ethical model of information consumption. If there were only one book left on Earth, who should get to read it first? Thinking about this extreme reveals, in myself, an intuition similar to the judgment of the librarian who gave the "adult" books to the adult. If the last book on Earth is about algebra, it is worth considering whether the most gifted mathematician should get to read it first. 

But I am certain that, in my life, jumping into a topic without prerequisite knowledge or any real hope of comprehending has always manufactured a valuable understanding, even if it is not always an understanding of the content. Allowing someone to tell you when you should learn something risks missing the experience of discovering what you are looking for when you want to learn something you've been deemed not ready to learn.
