The question is not "should I use React or Vue?"
The question is "what are the ideas in React and Vue?"
And then "what do I think about those ideas?"

The good idea I found in React is the notion that the view is a function of 
state.
The same idea is found in other places.
Elm expresses this idea as `view : Model -> Html`.

I use React because it enables me to put a good idea into practice.
I would use anything that enables me to use a good idea.
And I would avoid something that made a good idea hard to use.
I am invested in ideas, not in languages or the libraries.

Ideas are the most portable unit of programming knowledge.
Languages, libraries, and frameworks are merely the ephemera of ideas.
The future success of a language or a library or a framework cannot be 
predicted.
But we can bring good ideas with us into that future, whatever it is.

Kyle Simpson recently gave a talk titled "Keep Betting on JavaScript".
The title is a reference to Brendan Eich's encouragement to "always bet on 
JavaScript".
The rational for their exuberance is simply that JavaScript has been a winning
bet in the past.
Past performance is not an indicator of future results.

Languages and libraries are the ephemera of ideas.

Investing in the idea gives me the freedom to move away from any particular 
implementation.
Owning the idea gives me a value that I can spend anywhere.
When I own the idea, I am not tied to any particular implementation.

Components, lifecycle methods, asynchronous rendering, even the virtual DOM 
&mdash; these are details and often distractions.

I would use anything that enables me to use this good idea.
And I would not use something that 

The idea is not to use React. 
React just enables me to apply the idea.
And so I use React because I like the idea.
I would use anything that enabled me to apply this idea.
And I would not use something that prohibited me from using this idea.
I am invested in the idea, not in the language or the library.

React is not about components, lifecycle methods, or asynchronous rendering.
It's not even exactly about the virtual DOM.
Those are details and often distractions.
React is for me just a way to access a simple mental model: 
`view :: State -> DOM`.

Ideas in programming are the most portable unit of knowledge.
Ideas are have the longest lifespan.
For me, the basic idea of React is that the view is a function of state.
The essence of React has nothing to do lifecycle methods, asynchronous rendering.
It's not even exactly about the virtual DOM.
These are details and often distractions.
The idea is that I define my view as a function from state to dom.
The type of the Elm architecture function is `view : a -> Html`.
This is often refined to `view : Model -> Html`.

The benefit I get from React is the ability to reason about my view as a 
function of application state.
The rest of it is not important to me.
It might sometimes be useful.
But what I take away is the idea.

Investing in the idea gives me the freedom to move away from any particular 
implementation.
Owning the idea gives me a value that I can spend anywhere.
If I stopped using React tomorrow, I can still use that fundamental idea of 
React.

Knowledge of libraries is a currency that can be spent anywhere the library is
used.
Libraries are the amusement park tokens of the programming world.
This knowledge is not very valuable and it's value does not last for very long.
Knowledge of languages is a currency that can be spent anywhere that the 
language is used.
Languages are the fiat currencies of the programming world.
This knowledge can be quite valuable and the value can last for a long time.
Ideas are a currency that can be spent anywhere.
Ideas are the gold of the programming world.
Their value enjoys near universal and timeless recognition.

That is not to say that all ideas are gold.
Some ideas seem good at the outset and are proven wrong through experience.
But when you have found an idea that works for you in practice, then you have
found something of value.
That is why I invest in good ideas.

Thinking about ideas also helps you to answer these questions about "should I 
use x or y?" 
Use what best enables you to apply the ideas you've invested in.
Then I don't need to rely on dubious heuristics like Github stars to make the
decision.
And with that same knowledge I can clearly know when not to use that library.
Use the library as a way to apply an idea.
Apply the idea until the idea looses it's usefulness or a more useful idea is 
found.
When I choose to use a library or a language because it of it's relationship to
an idea, then I can be confident that it will work for me.

I like React because it allows me to leverage a good idea.
But I'm not attached to React because I can take that good idea somewhere else.
Eventually, I will.
Or I will find a better idea.
