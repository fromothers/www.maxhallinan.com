- Why isn't an annotation layer built into the internet itself?
- The web _is_ already annotated.
  - Comments are one common form of annotation
  - Links often act as annotations (linking to content that augments or supports
    the context of the link)
  - Web pages sometimes have things like footnotes, edit logs, and other metadata.
  - Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit are often locations for annotation-like 
    statements about content located somewhere else on the network. An article
    on a news site, for example.
- The idea is almost as old as the web itself
- There are ongoing attempts to add this layer to the web
- None of them have really caught on
- Why?
  - Control
