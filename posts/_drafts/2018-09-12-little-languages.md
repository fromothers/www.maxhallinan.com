- Programming languages are collections of ideas.
- Some of these ideas are simple; some of these ideas are complex.
- Learning a programming language is about more than learning the syntax.
- Learning a programming language is about learning the ideas.
- For example, learning Haskell involves learning about the concept of a 
  typeclass.
- To learn the language, you really need to learn the ideas in the language.
- Some of these ideas are complex.
- Sometimes it is hard to isolate the idea.
- To understand the idea, it would be helpful to remove it from the larger 
  context of the idea in which the language is encountered.
- For example, it might be helpful to focus on "what is a typeclass" in general, 
  rather than "what are typeclasses in Haskell".
- When I knew little about Haskell, I conflated the idea of a typeclass and the 
  mathematical origins of many typeclasses found in Haskell.
- The mistake I made is that typeclasses are a mathematical concept.
- The details and the context of Haskell typeclasses made it harder to see them
  for what they were, which is a set of operations that can be performed on a 
  type.
- It would be easier to understand typeclasses by focuses on them in isolation.
- You can do this through writing.
- I can write something that says this is what typeclasses are about.
- Then someone who wants to understand typeclasses can read what I have written.
- I think this works okay, more or less.
- Except that a lot of the understanding of programming languages is an intuitive
  understanding of how to apply the ideas, a feel for how they work. 
- So the to teach someone what a typeclass is, you want to give them this feel, 
  this intuition.
- Another way towards this end is to build a little language that is entirely 
  about demonstrating what a typeclass is. 
- The language would not be a generally applicable language. 
- You should be able to use the language to do something. There should be some 
  interesting outcome of using the language, just as LOGO was used to instruct
  the turtle to draw pictures.
- But the language would not be fully featured for use by professional 
  programmers.
- The language would constitute a microworld of typeclasses. 
- It would be more like a toy.
- And by playing with the toy, you can come to understand the idea of a typeclass.
- So you could have a whole toy chest of these little languages.
- And as your learning to program, you can take out the typeclass toy or the 
  time abstraction toy, or whatever, and you can focus on each of these concepts.
- You can learn the concept and then you can progress in the language that 
  uses that concept. 
- This would help you to separate pure concept from implementation details.
- Mary Rose Cook's Isla language is an example of this idea.
- The language is just about defining objects.
- It can't be used for anything practical. 
- But it does a nice job of conveying this idea of "objects definitions" which 
  is a core concept in practical programming.
