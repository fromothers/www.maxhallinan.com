- medical science and the practice of medicine rely on an understanding of what's
  happening in the body
- medical science and the practice of medicine seem to solve problems in two ways
  - attempt to understand the underlying cause of a problem and extrapolate that
    cause to a treatment
    - if my doctor understands that my stomach aches because I have too much
      stomach acid, he can relieve my stomach pain by addressing the acid levels.
  - discover treatments for problems (often by accident) that are not 
    understood or only partially understood.
    - then look for the "mechanism of action", use the treatment as a clue to 
      the cause of the problem.
- in both cases, the effectiveness of medicine is enhanced by understanding 
  the causes of the disease
- understanding the causes of the disease means having an accurate model of the 
  human organism
- thus it would seem that making progress in the field of medicine is a matter
  making and improving these models
- if this is true, the question becomes how accurate do these models need to be?
- it is possible that the human organism is so complex that understanding certain
  diseases would require a 1:1 correspondance between the model and subject
- we have relatively good models for some diseases. broken bones for instance.
  - the information that we have about broken bones generally enables us to make
    provide good treatments
- but some diseases are without treatments because the disease is not well 
  understood
- or perhaps the disease is well understood but human biology is not understood
  well enough to engineer a cure
- it seems possible that some diseases are so complex that they can be 
  understood only as an interaction of many factors in the body
- disease as an emergent property not of any one part of system in the body but
  of the interactions of these systems, something like weather patterns or 
  cultural trends
- disease can appear to be emerge from chaos, and in order to understand the
  disease, one must model that chaos
- to understand what's happening in the body, one must model the processes of 
  the organism
- at some point, if one accepts this premise, one finds that one will need to 
  produce a model for each human with a 1:1 correspondance to that human 
  organism if one hopes to provide perfectly effective medical treatment
- at the point where there is a 1:1 correspondance between the model and the 
  subject, one might find that a human has not merely been modelled but simulated
- it is this line of thought which explains why i would prefer to be a human
  simulation and not a biological human
- if i am simulated, then i am debuggable.
