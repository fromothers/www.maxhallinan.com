## I.

It was an odd feeling, pulling out from my parents' driveway, alone in a moving 
car for the first time.
Earlier that day, I had passed the licensing test.
Now I could drive anywhere unsupervised.
I was comfortable driving, had driven from Ohio to Florida, had waited longer 
than most to take the test.
But suddenly I felt the old clumsiness, was taken back to my first day behind 
the wheel.

It's time for me to take Haskell out on the open road.
I've worked through much of the [Haskell book](http://haskellbook.com/).
In doing so, I've written many lines of Haskell code.
Now it is time to write Haskell programs.
Here I am again, suddenly alone in command of a powerful tool. 
And once again, I feel like I am starting from the beginning.

## II.

I find that learning to program is about acquiring two forms of understanding.
The first is an intellectual understanding, acquired through study.
The second is a practical understanding, acquired through practice.
Coding exercises, while practical, fall into the first category.

of what I am doing.
The second is a practical understanding of what I am doing.
I find that learning to program is a continual interleaving of 
Spend months reading a book about a topic, even doing exercises on that topic, 
and set have no real practical understanding of the topic.
In the same way, one can spend months applying something without understanding it
intellectually, without being able to explain why it works the way it does.
Can have a strong understanding of why it works with a weak understanding of how
to apply it.
And can have a weak understanding of why something works with a strong understanding
of how to apply it.

Learning to program 

Drivers rarely return to driving school.
The skill is learned once and then practiced, less intentionally than 
incidentally, as the driver goes about their day.
But I find that learning to program is a continual interleaving of two 
activities, study and practice.

I prefer to start with book learning.
When I embark on a new topic, I start
