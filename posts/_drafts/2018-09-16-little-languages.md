## I.

Programming languages are collections of ideas.
Learning a programming language means learning to apply the ideas found in the
language.
But sometimes it is hard to isolate the ideas.

Language details might obscure ideas in the language.
For example, some typeclasses in Haskell obey some algebraic laws.
Because I was exposed to those typeclasses first, I expected this to be true of 
every typeclass.
I misunderstood the idea of a typeclass as a way to group types by laws.

I had actually come into contact with two ideas.
First, types can be grouped by operations on those types.
Second, _sometimes_ those groups are principled.
Only the first is essential to the idea of a typeclass.
Because of the frequent coincidence of both ideas in Haskell, I didn't perceive
them as separate ideas.

## II.

Learning a programming language means learning a set of ideas.
But sometimes the details of the language obscure the ideas.
Then it might be helpful to engage with the ideas first outside of the language.
The programming language as a set of ideas could be decomposed to a little
language for each idea.

A little language would not be used for general purpose programming.
It would not replace large languages, those languages that are sets of ideas.
When encountering a new idea in a large language, I could reach for the little
language of that idea.
Then I would return to the large language when I had gained an intuition for
applying that idea.

[Isla](http://islalanguage.org/) is a little language, a language for the idea
of modeling data.
There are only a few functions in Isla, none that are defined by the user.
The language has no control flow, no booleans, no numbers.
An Isla programmer defines things like shapes, planets, or people, and describes
those things by giving them attributes.

The little language need not be specific to any single large language.
Using objects to model entities is a practice found in many languages.
Programming in Isla yields an intuition for this practice that can be ported to 
any large language.

## III.

There is a [room](https://www.deutsches-museum.de/en/exhibitions/communication/mathematics/) 
in the Deutsches Museum that is filled with unusual toys.
Some are blocks that fit together like puzzles.
Others have strange forms that cause the object to roll in unexpected ways.

Each toy models a mathematical idea.
The toy makes the idea concrete.
Playing with the toy yields an intuition for the idea.
With these toys, one can say 
"Here's how tetrahedra combine to form a cube. Here's how the oloid rolls."

I wish for more languages like these toys. 
I don't want to install and provision a database just to play with an outer join.

Programming languages are tools that we use to employee the computer in the 
completion of other tasks.

A programming language is a tool.
A tool exists to help a human do something.
Programming languages are tools that are commonly used to write programs.
Books, lectures, and exercises are some tools that are commonly used to learn how
to use programming languages to write programs.


And it seems that the tools we use to learn programming languages

Programming languages are not always 
The job that humans 
is not always to write a computer program.

meant to extend human capability.

We need not assume that all languages must be fully-featured.


And someday, one can imagine a room like that room in the Deutsches Museum, 
a virtual room lined with shelves filled with little languages.

When Daniel Friedman and David Christiansen sought to explain dependent typing,
they did not point to a large, dependently typed language like Idris.
Instead they designed a language called [Pie](https://github.com/the-little-typer/pie) 
just for the purpose of demonstrating the idea.

I wish for a virtual room where programmers can play with ideas isolated from 
the complexity of the large languages.

I wish for a room like this, a virtual room filled with little languages.

where I can find the little language
of a programming idea.

Each toy is accompanied by a summary of the math it models.
The toys make the math concrete and playing with the toys is meant to yield an 
intuition for the underlying abstractions.


I wish for a virtual room filled with little languages.

This is what a little language could be, a limited context in which a single 
abstraction is made concrete.

These toys are like little languages.

I wish for a virtual room filled with little languages.
A virtual cabinet of drawers, each labeled with the name of an idea in 
programming. 
When I am engaging with that idea, 

- A lot of the understanding of programming languages is an intuitive
  understanding of how to apply the ideas, a feel for how they work.
- You should be able to use the language to do something. There should be some
  interesting outcome of using the language, just as LOGO was used to instruct
  the Turtle to draw pictures.
- So you could have a whole toy chest of these little languages.
