## I.

Bret Victor's idea of the Dynamic Medium puts a lot of emphasis on visual modes
of communication.
Most of Victor's demos are highly visual.
And Victor is dismissive of text as the medium for expressing software.
In "The Future of Computing" Victor talks about how people who programmed in
assembly rejected higher-level languages.
Then he draws a parallel between those assembly programmers then and text-based
programming now.

Text is my most efficient and effective means of communication.

## II.

What I see in Bret Victor's demos is a directness of manipulation.
Victor's interfaces enable him achieve the desired result directly.
The gestures afforded by Bret Victor's interfaces enable him to communicate his
intent directly to the computer.

Text-based programming is indirect.
To visualize data, I have to describe the visualization to the computer in a
relatively round-about way.
Text-based programming, which is the most common form for non-trivial
programming suffers not from being text but from being indirect.
Victor's demos are attractive because they raise the level of abstraction,
enabling people to do things in a short time that normally takes them a long
time to do.
Tactile manipulation of a graphical interface seems to be Victor's preferred
means of interacting with software, but the directness of his experience is
possible through interfaces.

## III.

Text can be direct too.
Text-based interfaces are among the most direct.
I work faster when I am typing.
I can say exactly what I mean when I am typing.

What I see when I watch Bret Victor's demos are domain-specific languages.
These languages aren't text-based and the domain is often very narrow.
They are domain-specific languages for domains like drawing a fish or exploring
wave behavior.
The language is not text-base.
The language is implied by the software interface, which is visual and tactile.

What these demos demonstrate to me is the economy and efficiency that is gained
when you have a language specific to the domain you are working in.

## IV.

But we all understand that domain-specific languages and general-purpose
languages are not the same thing.
To claim that text-based programming is antiquated because here is a demo of
ad-hoc software developed to solve a specific problem (visualize data, draw a
fish, explore wave patterns), and this ad-hoc software happens to be
tactile/visual is not a compelling argument.

I could achieve the same directness by making a text-based language.

## V.

It's not just directness, it's also about giving the user feedback.
Bret Victor's demos rest on the principal that the user should be given direct
feedback about what they're doing.

If you are doing something visual, then the medium for creating that thing
should be visual.
Writing a program in text that generates an image is like painting by writing a
description of what you intend to paint.
This makes sense to me.

## VI.

But don't we already have

There are two fallacies here:

- He's almost certainly right that any technology we can name today will be
  replaced by something else at some point in the future, given a long enough
  extension of the future.
- To say "It certainly won't be software" is to contradict the earlier assertion
  that we can't foresee what will be important in 100 years.
- Software _might_ be important in 100 years. 
  The point is we don't know.
- I want text-based interfaces to have a place in the future.
- That need not mean writing JavaScript in Vim.
- I'm not saying that I hope the current incarnation of text-based interfaces
  persists for 100 years.
- But I do hope that the category continues to exist because I prefer text to 
  images.
