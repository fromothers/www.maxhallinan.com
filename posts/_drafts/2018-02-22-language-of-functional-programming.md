"How close is the Redux connect() function to a Bifunctor (see Fantasy Land for 
details) ? Honest question. Could it have been designed with bimap somehow?"

"Seems like a contramap to me. So a contravariant bifunctor abstracting the 
connect function itself as a builder"

"As people start seeing this in different libraries, maybe they’ll be 
interested in the general pattern. The point is you don’t have to understand 
the general pattern to get up to speed and use this kind of thing."

"When you want to tell something, there’s a general pattern here. What do you 
call it? Is it a little bit like we say…

You call it a monad, of course. Obviously. "

I haven't felt like I understood math since I finished eighth-grade algebra.
What I remember about eight-grade algebra is that I learned about some laws and 
then I was asked to apply those laws to math problems.
There was usually a suggested technique for applying the law to the problem.
Some students became skilled at memorizing which techniques go with which kinds
of math problems.
The laws weren't useful information to them unless the question was about which
law applied.
I didn't really like memorizing this decision tree.
Choosing something because I had been told it was the right choice did not 
satisfy me.
I was a successful algebra student because I felt like (and must have, to some
degree) understood the principles.
I didn't have any deep insight into these laws but I internalized them. 
They seemed natural to me and I liked recognizing how a math problem followed 
those laws.
Solving the problem was a demonstration of my understanding and proving that 
I understood the principle satisfied me.

I do not have a clear memory of my life with math after algebra.
I remember feeling stupid and I remember resenting students who got good grades.
These were the same students who had learned algebra by memorizing which 
calculation techniques go with which kinds of math problems.
I thought they were mindless because they could not explain what a "cosine" or
a "coefficient" meant, just when and how to use them.
It seemed unjust to me that they were rewarded for blindly following 
instructions.
I needed to internalize the principle of those instructions before I could or 
would follow those instructions.
But the game was plugging the right numbers into the right formula and 
writing down the result.
My math grades steadily declined and my math education concluded early, in 
my third year of high school.
I barely passed the class and turned in at least one test that was covered with
drawings instead of answers.
I was headed to art school and assumed that drawing, not math, was what I would
be doing with my life anyways.

It's been awhile since I've done any drawing but sometimes I do watch some math 
videos on the internet.
Programming is the reason for both of these unexpected outcomes.

I avoided programming until I was twenty-seven because I assumed that 
programmers must be good at math.

Math made me feel stupid.

I learn best when I use some information to take an action.
The action is informed by how I understand the information and the result of the
action either confirms or denies the correctness of my understanding.
If my understanding is confirmed, I add to the information and test again.
If my understanding is denied, I adjust my understanding and try again.
In this way, I feel my way toward comprehension.

I think I learn through experience, through using a piece of information 
I figured that I would graduate, go to art school, and use very little math 
after that.

This was frustrating.
In the world of programming, when it can sometimes feel exhausting to be learning
so many new things
