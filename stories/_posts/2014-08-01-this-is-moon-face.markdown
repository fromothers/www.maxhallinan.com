![Moon-Face sitting with his head in his hands.](/static/img/this-is-moon-face/1.jpg)

He is called Moon-Face because his cheeks are covered with craters.


![Moon-Face standing on his chair looking out the window.](/static/img/this-is-moon-face/2.jpg)

Like the moon, his cratered face hides from&nbsp;the&nbsp;day.

Even when the leaves are open and the morning is&nbsp;less&nbsp;weary


![Moon-Face's window boarded shut.](/static/img/this-is-moon-face/4.jpg)

Moon-Face shuts his window anyways.


![Moon-Face hammering nails into boards.](/static/img/this-is-moon-face/5.jpg)

Do not try to visit him in his lonely room.


![Moon-Face sitting on the floor surrounded by a hammer and nails with a distraught expression.](/static/img/this-is-moon-face/6.jpg)

He will wait there for one month. Alone.


![Moon-Face on a ladder painting the side of his house.](/static/img/this-is-moon-face/7.jpg)

Always inside except when he paints the house&hellip;


![Moon-Face mowing the lawn.](/static/img/this-is-moon-face/8.jpg)

&hellip;or mows the lawn.

![Moon-Face peering through the boards nailed over his window.](/static/img/this-is-moon-face/10.jpg)

You will understand his grimace if you look out&nbsp;his&nbsp;window.


![People with unfriendly expressions looking up at Moon-Face.](/static/img/this-is-moon-face/11.jpg)

Peer throught the boards. Do you see the skulking public? The sidewalks overflow.


![A crowd of people with unfriendly expressions.](/static/img/this-is-moon-face/12.jpg)

They are too noisy and crowding, those&nbsp;public&nbsp;people.


![Unfriendly people bumping Moon-Face.](/static/img/this-is-moon-face/13.jpg)

Their rudeness does not bother their&nbsp;wrinkled&nbsp;hearts.


![Moon-Face in the middle of a crowd throwing his hands up in despair.](/static/img/this-is-moon-face/14.jpg)

&ldquo;All were children once,&rdquo; thinks Moon-Face. He retches. &ldquo;How rotten they have become.&rdquo;


![The crowd leering at Moon-Face as he walks away.](/static/img/this-is-moon-face/15.jpg)

Moon-Face dreads the power of the public people.


![Moon-Face sitting against a wall covering his face in shame.](/static/img/this-is-moon-face/16.jpg)

Easily Moon-Face is defeated if the public people say &ldquo;Look at that wrinkled melon-head&#33;&rdquo;


![Moon-Face sneaking out of his house at night.](/static/img/this-is-moon-face/17.jpg)

Only the night is a little escape.

![A woman turning on a light and looking at Moon-Face with an expression of shock and disgust.](/static/img/this-is-moon-face/18.jpg)

But Moon-Face will always lose the affection of a lady in the light of her room.


![Moon-Face with a hammer about to break a mirror.](/static/img/this-is-moon-face/19.jpg)

This is Moon-Face. He has no talent or beauty.


![Moon-Face sitting with his back to the broken mirror.](/static/img/this-is-moon-face/20.jpg)

There are these people in the world.
