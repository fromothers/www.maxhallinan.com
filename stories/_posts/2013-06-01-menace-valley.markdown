![There was an unhealthy menace who ruled the rooster's nest for awhile.](/static/img/menace-pile/1.jpg)

![In time, Roland pushed that menace away.](/static/img/menace-pile/2.jpg)

![Menace rolls away](/static/img/menace-pile/3.jpg)

![Only, the menace took time to leave.](/static/img/menace-pile/4.jpg)

![Menace knocking someone over as it rolls away](/static/img/menace-pile/5.jpg)

!["Keep moving you menace, no one wants you here!"](/static/img/menace-pile/6.jpg)

![That menace found his way to menace valley.](/static/img/menace-pile/7.jpg)

![But menace valley became too full. Soon all the menaces would come spilling out.](/static/img/menace-pile/8.jpg)

![Roland alone saw how frothy and upset the menace pile grew.](/static/img/menace-pile/9.jpg)

!["We need a real change," Roland said to Factor. "No more keeping these menaces around."](/static/img/menace-pile/10.jpg)

![What Roland said was right. So Factor ate a midnight snack to keep the menace population down.](/static/img/menace-pile/11.jpg)

![Later on when Factor burped, he filled the sky with stars.](/static/img/menace-pile/12.jpg)
